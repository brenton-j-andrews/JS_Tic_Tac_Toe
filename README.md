# JS_Tic_Tac_Toe
Another Tic Tac Toe game, this time in Javascript. Completed for The Odin Project: 
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe


I did a tic-tac-toe implementation in Python a few months ago, hoping that the end product with this project will
be much cleaner and improved upon. Will be implementing the minimax algorithm from scratch this time to see
if I can piece it together.
